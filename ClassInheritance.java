/* DIRECTIONS:
I want you to use the code I have supplied for Vehicle and Car, and expand on this. 
Look up vehicle specs on the web.

I want each person to create 2 Class files that inherit from Car, as well as 2 Boat Classes, 
2 Airplane classes, and 2 other vehicle Classes (impress me!). I basicallty want 
to get you used to using inheritance.

You can override the toString to print out speial characteristics, use the Speedometer methods 
as needed (should all speeds be in mph?). I may give extra credit if I am impressed by someone's 
imaginitive coding. Please make sure to comment everything well.
