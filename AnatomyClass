    An int variable called enginePower (in Horse Power)
    A double variable called maxSpeed (in MPH)
    A double variable called price (in $)

    I suggest you start a control main method in the Main class, 
    and use this to construct a single car object from the 
    Car class as you go along, to help debug.

    Write a constructor to produce a base car.

    Write methods to set and get the brand, enginePower, as well as 
    carSpeed and price

    Write a toString method to print out these details.

    Write a driver method in main to create car types VW Bug, 
    Toyota Prius, BMW i8, Tesla Model 3, 
    give them the enginePower and maxSpeed as you wish, 
    and print these details out.*/
