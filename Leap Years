//Write a program that reads an integer value from the user rep-
resenting a year. The purpose of the program is to determine if
the year is a leap year (and therefore has 29 days in February)
in the Gregorian calendar. Use a boolean variable isLeapYear for 
this (initialize to false).  

A year is a leap year if it is divisable by 4, unless it is also 
divisable by 100 but not 400. For example, the year 2003 is not a leap year, 
but 2004 is. The year 1900 is not a leap year because it is divisable by 
100 but not 400, and the year 2000 is a leap year because it is divisable by
100, and also divisable by 400. Produce an error message for
any input value less than 1582 (the year the Gregorian calendar
was adopted).

        // User Input for Year
         Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
         System.out.print("Enter a year: ");
         int year = input.nextInt();
        
        //THE BOOLEAN
         boolean isLeapYear = false; 
        // start by assuming it's not a leap year

        // Year 1582 Check (Gregorian Calendar)
         if (year < 1582) {
            System.out.println("Error. Must be after Gregorian Calendar Begins");
         } 
         else {
            // Leap year logic
             if (year % 4 == 0) {
                 if (year % 100 == 0) {
                     if (year % 400 == 0) {
                         isLeapYear = true; // divisible by 400 â†’ leap year
                    }
                } else {
                    //If the number meets all the requirements above, it is a true leapyear
                    isLeapYear = true; 
                }
            }

            // Show Answer
             if (isLeapYear) {
                 System.out.println(year + " is a leap year.");
             } else {
                 System.out.println(year + " is not a leap year.");
             }
